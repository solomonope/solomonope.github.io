title: About me 
---

I am Folorunsho Solomon Opeyemi, Diabetic Software Engineer, Living in the very beautiful and green city of hamburg.

I struggle with social interaction, mainly because the voices in my head keep quite busy

I am a school taught Electronics Engineer and a self taught Computer Scientist/Mathematician , it is not uncommon to hear me say my biggest regret was not study computer science in school, in retrospect, I think if I had studied computer science, I would have regretted not studying Electronics Engineering, what can I say I want what I donâ€™t have.

I have been in love with several things in my life, but nothing compares with my love for mathematics, code and computer science, this blog is my attempt to share that love and passion with you  :)
